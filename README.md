# AgrouAgouBot
Telegram Bot running on a Raspberry pie 3


Using this framework: https://github.com/nickoala/telepot

Doc for that framework: http://telepot.readthedocs.io/



You need to install the framework and put the token of your bot in the main.py file (around line 216).
You may need to create a "`__init__.py`" file at the root of your folder. This file can remain empty, it is simply there for the python project (inter-file linking).

The bot is launched by a simple "python main.py"

More info to come... and a (highly needed) code clean-up as well...
